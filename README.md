# Dino-Game-Clone

## Description

This is a clone of the `Chrome Dino Game` built as a web application on [`React`](https://react.dev/). It is deployed on [`AWS Elastic Beanstalk`](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) using [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/) and Docker Compose, with a complete CI/CD workflow using [`GitHub Actions`](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Deployment

#### Step 1: Setting up Dinosaur Game clone as React web application

1. Create a new React project using commands:
`npx create-react-app (app-name)` \
`cd (app-name)`

2. Install necessary dependencies:
`npm install styled-components`\
`npm install @react-spring/web`

3. My Project Structure overview on VS Code:

5. Game Components
   
Create [`Game.js`](https://github.com/aakanksha-k/DinoGame-Clone/blob/master/src/components/Game.js) file to manage the game state and render other logical components like, Obstacle Spawning, Collision Detection. 

Create [`Dino.js`](https://github.com/aakanksha-k/DinoGame-Clone/blob/master/src/components/Dino.js) to represent the dinosaur avatar and handle jumping over the said obstacles. 

Create [`Obstacle.js`](https://github.com/aakanksha-k/DinoGame-Clone/blob/master/src/components/Obstacle.js) to represent obstacles and manage their movement.

Integrated the above components in [`App.js`](https://github.com/aakanksha-k/DinoGame-Clone/blob/master/src/App.js)

5. Testing
Run the application to test all game mechanics using: \
`npm start`

Ensure the development server starts correctly and the game functions as expected on the local browser.

#### Step 2: Developing React app inside Docker container
1.	Run the command in an empty directory in VS Code to run a container of nodejs
`docker run -it -v$(PWD:/app -p 3000:3003 node16.20.2 sh)`

2. Go inside docker container using `cd app`
3. Initialise a new react application using `npx create-react-app .`
4.	Once initialized, add all the components & files, of Dino Game clone from the earlier directory.

5.	Ensure react application is running correctly on the local browser

\
Hence, a basic react web application is successfully built inside the docker container.

#### Step 3: Containerizing the app using Docker + Docker Compose

1. Exit from the docker container using command `exit`
2.	Create a [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/aakanksha-k/DinoGame-Clone/blob/master/Dockerfile) for production
3.	Create a [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/aakanksha-k/DinoGame-Clone/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file, such that it can run the images from Dockerfile as a container on the main, Elastic Beanstalk server
4.	Test the build on local machine using `docker-compose up --build`

#### Step 4: Configuring AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1. Create a sample web application & it‚Äôs environment using the AWS EB console

#### Step 5: Deploying the custom application on AWS EB with CI/CD workflow using Github actions

1. Create `.github/workflows` folder in your local repository & add [`deploy-aws.yml`](https://github.com/aakanksha-k/DinoGame-Clone/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-aws.yml) file, including the triggers, branches & actions
2.	Commit & Push the repo to GitHub as ‚ÄòDeploy React to AWS EB‚Äô

3.	Once workflow is successfully executed & the custom, DinoGame Clone web application is deployed to AWS EB, check the domain from AWS EB console.
